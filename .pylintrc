# Ignore import-error because it gives errors trying to import django. No idea why.
# Ignore no-member - looks like it is being detected improperly.

# Temporarily ignored - bare-except - TODO
# Temporarily ignored - R (refactoring) - TODO
# Temporarily ignored - abstract-method - TODO?

# Disable C0411, C0412, C0413 because imports are handled by isort
# Disable R0801 because of the issue in pylint where it cannot be partially disabled. https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/214
